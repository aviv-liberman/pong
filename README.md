This project is a minimal example of bringing a classic arcade game to the web with zero dependencies — just HTML, JS, and WASM.  
It’s small, fast, and perfect as a base for learning how to:

- Export LÖVE games to web using love.js  
- Host LÖVE projects with **GitHub Pages**  
- Work with lightweight game loops and collision logic
